**2D Obstacle Mapping Detection and Mapping**
A Python-based simulation of a compact HEXAPOD robot performing real-time 2D obstacle detection and environment mapping using virtual ultrasonic sensor modeling.

The main goal of this project is to explore undisclosed and potentially hazardous terrains using robotic systems equipped with distance sensors. By enabling the robot to sense obstacles and understand its surroundings, the system can gather critical spatial information before human intervention.t.

**Project Overview**
1.A robot navigating in a 2D environment
2.Virtual ultrasonic sensor rays simulating real-world distance sensors
3.Obstacle detection through continuous distance measurements
4.Real-time visualization of detected objects and mapped areas
5.Dynamic environment updates using Matplotlib for live monitoring
